<h1 style="font-size: 50px; text-align: center;">About Me!</h1>
	<br><br><br>
	<p style="font-size: 25px; padding: 15px; margin: 20px;">Hello! I am Nayyirah Tazmeen. I was born in 2012, May. I started coding on 2021, when i was eight years old. I started coding before i started my coding course with scratch jr which my brother taught me how to use so when i started taking classes scratch jr was easy as i already knew how to use basics. I wanted to code because i saw a lot of people making games so i wanted to do that too.
  <img style="width: 200px; float: right;" src="laptop.jpeg">  My favorite app to learn was scratch (not scratch jr) which is an app that lets you make games by using pre-made code blocks. I also really love art! On February 20 2024 this year at my school there was an art competion. My school also had a math competion with 3 rounds. The second round was the selection round for final and only two people from my class were selected, me and another girl. My favorite thing to paint is skys so on the art competion i painted a wndow with a sunset backround, infront of the window was the main focus which was a basket of flowers. I also wanted to paint a sleeping cat but time ran out.I also love reading and currently have atleast 50 books!
